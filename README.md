MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) has been designed and developed for an ultra-low bandwidth communication and has been applied to used in Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, MQTT has been used in traditional TCP/IP networks. Yet, the ultra-low bandwidth and long-range communication of MQTT have been considerably increased. Previous proposed techniques still struggle to make MQTT compatible with Long-Range (LoRa) networks. In this paper, we have design and implement the Telemetry Media Access Control (TMAC). Our TMAC helps increase ranges of MQTTâ€™s data communications. We have experimented our TMAC using a network testbed. Experimental results have illustrated that our TMAC can transfer data over 5 kilometers with low network overhead.
